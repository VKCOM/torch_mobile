Parent classes: [[DiskFile|DiskFile]]

A ''PipeFile'' is a particular ''File'' which is able to perform basic read/write operations
on a command pipe. It implements all methods described in [[DiskFile|DiskFile]] and [[File|File]].

The file might be open in read or write mode, depending on the parameter
''mode'' (which can take the value ''"r"'' or ''"w"'') 
given to the [[#torch.PipeFile|torch.PipeFile(fileName, mode)]]. Read-write mode is not allowed.

//Constructor// which execute ''command'' by opening a pipe in read or write
''mode''. Valid ''mode'' are ''"r"'' (read) or ''"w"'' (write). Default is read
mode.

If (and only if) ''quiet'' is ''true'', no error will be raised in case of
problem opening the file: instead ''nil'' will be returned.
