Parent classes: [[File|File]]

A ''MemoryFile'' is a particular ''File'' which is able to perform basic
read/write operations on a buffer in ''RAM''. It implements all methods
described in [[File|File]].

The data of the this ''File'' is contained into a ''NULL'' terminated
[[Storage|CharStorage]].

====  torch.MemoryFile([mode]) ====
{{anchor:torch.MemoryFile}}

//Constructor// which returns a new ''MemoryFile'' object using ''mode''. Valid
''mode'' are ''"r"'' (read), ''"w"'' (write) or ''"rw"'' (read-write). Default is ''"rw"''.


====  torch.MemoryFile(storage, mode) ====
{{anchor:torch.MemoryFile}}

//Constructor// which returns a new ''MemoryFile'' object, using the given
[[Storage|storage]] (which must be a ''CharStorage'') and ''mode''. Valid
''mode'' are ''"r"'' (read), ''"w"'' (write) or ''"rw"'' (read-write). The last character
in this storage //must// be ''NULL'' or an error will be generated. This allow
to read existing memory. If used for writing, not that the ''storage'' might
be resized by this class if needed. 

====  [CharStorage] storage() ====
{{anchor:torch.MemoryFile.storage}}

Returns the [[Storage|storage]] which contains all the data of the
''File'' (note: this is //not// a copy, but a //reference// on this storage). The
size of the storage is the size of the data in the ''File'', plus one, the
last character being ''NULL''.
